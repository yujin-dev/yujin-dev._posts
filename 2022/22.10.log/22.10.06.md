# [ISSUE] Flyte Contribution Task
1. DAG 실행 당일 날짜를 default로 하여 파라미터가 설정될 수 있도록 한다.
2. DAG Cronschedule이 UTC만 시간 설정이 가능하데, KTC로 반영될 수 있도록 한다.    
flyte DAG에서 default로 **오늘 날짜**로 설정하려 한다. 현재는 DAG가 생성된 시점만 고정으로 작동하게 된다.
*우선 날짜를 input으로 받을 경우 당일 날짜를 DAG가 실행되는 시점으로 설정될 수 있도록 기여하고자 한다.*

위 해당 metric을 수집할 때 실행되는 쿼리: https://github.com/prometheus-community/postgres_exporter/blob/7e02b9bd9b4956b29b5c9264769cb246f4b3cb6c/cmd/postgres_exporter/queries.go
> [Create Prometheus integrated Postgres custom metrics](https://www.ongres.com/blog/create-prometheus-integrated-postgres-custom-metrics/)

## custom metrics

### Path to a YAML file containing custom queries to run
Check out [queries.yaml](https://github.com/prometheus-community/postgres_exporter/blob/master/queries.yaml) for example format
- Flags : `extend.query-path`
- Environment Variables : `PG_EXPORTER_EXTEND_QUERY_PATH`

### Scrape metrics from all databases
Whether to discover the databases on a server dynamically. Default is false.
- Flags : `auto-discover-databases` 
- Environment Variables : `PG_EXPORTER_AUTO_DISCOVER_DATABASES`
true일 경우에는 모든 DSN(Data Source Name)에 대해 적용되므로 `SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datallowconn = true AND datistemplate = false and datname != current_database()`가 실행된다.

### Conclusion
모니터링하려는 DB를 설정해서 아래처럼 실행한다. `queries.yaml`에 쿼리를 직접 입력하여 metric을 수집하기로 한다.( 일단 default_metrics는 제외하였다 )
```
docker run -d --rm --name pgexporter --net=host -v $HOME/postgres_exporter:/home/postgres_exporter \
-e DATA_SOURCE_NAME="postgresql://{db_address_info}/{target_db}?sslmode=disable" -e PG_EXPORTER_EXTEND_QUERY_PATH=/home/postgres_exporter/queries.yaml -e PG_EXPORTER_DISABLE_DEFAULT_METRICS=false \
quay.io/prometheuscommunity/postgres-exporter
```

# [ERROR]  `OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: exec: "/bin/bash": stat /bin/bash: no such file or directory: unknown`
Docker Image가 Alpine이라면 /bin/bash를 지원하지 않을 수 있다. 대신 /bin/sh를 사용한다.
