# [OS] Process Concept
### Memory Layout of a process
- stack : temporary data storage when invoking functions
- heap : memory that is dynamically allocated
- data : global variables
- text : executable code

### Process vs. Program
- program : a passive entity
- process : active entity, with a program counter specifying the next instruction to execute and a set of associated resources

### Process State
- New : the process is being created
- Running : instructions are being executed
- Waiting : the process is waiting for some event to occur
- Ready : the process is waiting to be assigned to a processor
- Terminated : the process had finished
Only one process can be *running* on any processor core at any instant. Many processes can be *ready, waiting*.

### Process Control Block
Each process is represented in OS by a PCB, also called a task control block.
